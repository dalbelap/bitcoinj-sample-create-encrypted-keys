# BitcoinJ Sample to create and Cipher H. Deterministic Keys
===========

This project contains several sample class using cryptography to generate keys and married wallets with BitcoinJ. 

CreateHDKeys class creates and encrypt HD keys. It will generate 3 pair of keys and cipher with AES CBC the private keys. The data is storage in different json files.

See utils.encrypt.AESCBCUtils class for more simetric encryption details.
